Based on the fact, that the data access for SAP Application Enablement works only with OAuth 2.0.
WeÂ´ve prerpared an Node JS proxy application which allows u to fetch the data with basic authentification from your thing.

Please use for testing the follwoing credentials:

| User | Password |
| --- | --- |

The URL mus be adjusted a bit, the syntax is the follwoing:

https://sap-proxy.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/app.svc/measurements?$filter=id eq '**your-thing-id**' and time ge datetime'2018-06-15T00:00:00' and time lt datetime'2018-06-16T00:00:00'&$format=json&$top=3

**Please Adjust the datetime value to a valid period where u sure that the data was send successfully into SAP Application Enablement.**
