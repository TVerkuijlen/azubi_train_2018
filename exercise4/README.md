#### Discover the "proxy" OData Service for your Thing

Based on the fact, that the data access for SAP Application Enablement works only with OAuth 2.0.
WeÂ´ve prerpared an Node JS proxy application which allows u to fetch the data with basic authentification from your thing.

Please use for testing the follwoing credentials:

| User | Password |
| --- | --- |
| foo | bar|

The URL mus be adjusted a bit, the syntax is the follwoing:

https://sap-proxy.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/app.svc/measurements?$filter=id eq '**your-thing-id**' and time ge datetime'2018-06-15T00:00:00' and time lt datetime'2018-06-16T00:00:00'&$format=json&$top=3

**Please Adjust the datetime value to a valid period where u sure that the data was send successfully into SAP Application Enablement.**

As result u should now see the following response adapted to your thing:

<img src="./img/ODAT_RESP_PRXY.PNG" width="80%">

We want to use this OData service to display our last 3 measurements on SAP Mobile Cards.

For simplification a destination to get the data is created an can be used by the definition of your Card later.
