# Tutorial: Connect your Raspberry PI via MQTT with SAP Leonardo IoT

## Scenario Overview

In this sceanario we want to connect your device (Laptop or Raspberry PI) via [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/) with [SAP Leonardo IoT Foundation] (https://eaexplorer.hana.ondemand.com/_item.html?id=13741#!/overview), build up the "digital twin" and finally we want to create an SAP UI5 Application to display or device Information.
Optional: We create an mobile Application where we should be able to display our Device measeurements with SAP Mobile Cards

In Detail we split the scenario in the following parts:

Excercise 1: Create the Device with SAP IoT Service, connect the Raspberry PI and send you first data.
