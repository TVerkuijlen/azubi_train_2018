# Tutorial: Connect your Raspberry PI via MQTT with SAP Leonardo IoT

## Scenario Overview

In this sceanario we want to connect your device (Laptop or Raspberry PI) via [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/) with [SAP Leonardo IoT Foundation](https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/SAP_CP_IOT_CF/Cloud/en-US), build up the [Digital Twin](https://www.sap.com/documents/2017/10/beb6f299-db7c-0010-82c7-eda71af511fa.html) and finally we want to create an [SAP UI5] (https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/) Application to display or device Information.
Optional: We create an mobile Application where we should be able to display our Device measeurements with SAP Mobile Cards

In Detail we split the scenario in the following parts:

Excercise 1: Create the Device with SAP IoT Service, connect the Raspberry PI and send you first data.
