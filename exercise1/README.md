### Excercise 1 - Create the Device via SAP IoT Service

#### Create the Device 

Open the SAP IoT Service cockpit by opening the following URL: 

https://sycor.eu10.cp.iot.sap/iot/cockpit/#

<img src="./img/cockpit.PNG" alt="cockpit" width="80%">

Login with the provided user and password.
And choose the "Devices" entry and  press the + icon to create a new device:

In the upcoming screen specifiy your device like this:

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Name | e.g. Raspberry_PI_01 (identical to the user id from the cokpit user e.g 'azubi_01' = 01)|
| Gateway | MQTT network (id = 2) |

Congratulations! If the screen looks similiar to this, u have successfully created an IoT Device on SAP IoT Services.

The last step is now, to create a new "Sensor" an refer to an existing "Sensor Type" (for simplification the Sensor Type was created before).
To do this click again the + button and specify a new sensor:


| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Name | e.g. MySensor |
| Sensor Type | CPU_SensorType |


<img src="./img/create_sensor.PNG" alt="create sensor" width="60%">


The Sensor Type "CPU_SensorType" has the folowing definition:

As u cann see the Sensor Type contains two capabilities, one for the CPU usage in % and the second one can be used to send data back to our device. Because of the fact that we using MQTT we are able to communicate bi-directional with the device.


#### Download the Device Certificate

To communicate with our device on a secure way, itÂ´s required to download the device certificate by clicking the "Generate Device" button.
Please choose the "PEM" format:
